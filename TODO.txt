## Multithread cutting and hashing

It takes a while to find all the cut points for large files.
Start hashing the chunks meanwhile, at least for large files (use the mmap boundary?).
Return a chunk iterator that's some Hoare under the hood?

## Can we pipeline filter/unfilter?

Trouble is that breaks the nice abstraction that a filtered backend is just another backend.
It also has to be *behind* the cache, which is always unfiltered...

## Axe multiple versions of B2 if their SHAs match?

Also figure out how we're doing that in the first place.
(Failed uploads!? Seems it made it even though the upload 408'd because of the above.)

## backup accounting

Kinda weird to track new bytes in the backup threads and reused bytes in the main thread.
There's a reason for it - we don't know how many bytes trees are - but...

## Usage sizes

Have backend list give sizes so we can show the whole size of the repo?

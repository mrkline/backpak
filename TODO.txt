## `copy` command

- Reuse `walk_snapshots()` from `prune`

- We want it to be resumable like backups. Resue `find_resumable_backup()`?

- Move that into prune as well, with the starting index being WIP + reusable packs?
  Any command that could cause a large upload (backup, prune, copy) should probably be resumable.

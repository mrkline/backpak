## `copy` command

- Reuse `walk_snapshots()` from `prune`

- We want it to be resumable like backups. Resue `find_resumable_backup()`?

## More compact trees?

Should we make the keys in our tree CBOR smaller? Only have sizes for files?
See how much of a difference this actually makes once we compress them.

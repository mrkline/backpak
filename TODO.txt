## `copy` command

- Reuse `walk_snapshots()` from `prune`

- We want it to be resumable like backups. Resue `find_resumable_backup()`?

## More compact trees?

Should we make the keys in our tree CBOR smaller? Only have sizes for files?
See how much of a difference this actually makes once we compress them.

## backup accounting

Kinda weird to track new bytes in the backup threads and reused bytes in the main thread.
There's a reason for it - we don't know how many bytes trees are - but...

## Usage sizes

Have backend list give sizes so we can show the whole size of the repo?

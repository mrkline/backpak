## jiff?

- Should be able to drop into tree and snapshot - maybe with a little custom parsing?

- Named time zones sounds nice

- Rounding to nearest second seems nice for snapshots - any potential sorting issues?
  (Do we care? We'd like `snapshots` not to change based on backend fetch order,
  but do we need to guard against multiple snapshots per seconds? Git doesn't.)

## filter-snapshot

Make a new snapshot with previous contents of another in the same repo?

## Guard against colliding with another snapshot in the same working dir

Track working dir in some global state somewhere? Shmem?

## Compress after the cache?

Would require a fair amount of rework, but would also be a big speedup in-cache...
Probably not worth it...

## Can we pipeline filter/unfilter?

Trouble is that breaks the nice abstraction that a filtered backend is just another backend.
It also has to be *behind* the cache, which is always unfiltered...

## Axe multiple versions of B2 if their SHAs match?

Also figure out how we're doing that in the first place.
(Failed uploads!? Seems it made it even though the upload 408'd because of the above.)

## backup accounting

Kinda weird to track new bytes in the backup threads and reused bytes in the main thread.
There's a reason for it - we don't know how many bytes trees are - but...

## Usage sizes

Have backend list give sizes so we can show the whole size of the repo?

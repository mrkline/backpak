## `show` command

- Total bytes referenced (split into files/chunks and metadata/trees)

- Number of packs referenced (note packs may contain data from other snapshots)?

- Tree? merge with ls?

- Docs should explain that `cat` dumps raw data (JSON-ified records from files),
  `show` gathers metadata from a particular snapshot.

## `usage` command (or `statistics`? `info`?)

- Number of of all file types, size of those

- total size vs "unshared" sizes of all snapshots? (% duplicated?)

- Unused info in index? (a la prune)

The info we're showing is a combination of `snapshots` sizes (but summed)
and `prune`. Refactor their math into snapshot.rs?

...prune should also probably show how many bytes it pruned, huh?

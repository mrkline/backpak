## Reporting sizes

- When backing up, should report sizes:
  - Bytes reused (sum of blobs deduplicated/skipped)
  - Bytes of file data (chunks)
  - Bytes of metadata (trees)

  The last two should be simpleish - have the packers (chunk & tree) return sizes packed.
  The first will probably need to be threaded through the backup tree walk.

## `show` command

- Total bytes referenced (split into files/chunks and metadata/trees)

- Unique bytes vs reused bytes - need to separate the two a la `prune`,
  but just for a single snapshot instead of all of them.
  We can get each blob's length from the index!
  No need to read blobs or plumb # bytes read back through the tree cache.

  ...prune should also probably show how many bytes it pruned, huh?

- # Packs referenced (note packs may contain data from other snapshots)

- Docs should explain that `cat` dumps raw data (JSON-ified records from files),
  `show` gathers metadata from a particular snapshot.

## `backup --ignore`

- Take a regex

- Add a filter function to `walk_fs`? We already have the full path of each node;
  should be trivial to compare against.

## `show` command

- Total bytes referenced (split into files/chunks and metadata/trees)

- Number of packs referenced (note packs may contain data from other snapshots)?

- Tree? merge with ls?

- Docs should explain that `cat` dumps raw data (JSON-ified records from files),
  `show` gathers metadata from a particular snapshot.

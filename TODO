When packfiles are moved from the backup to the CWD, currently failing on

[ERROR] packer -> indexer channel exited early

Caused by:
    sending on a closed channel
    [ERROR] Duplicate pack received: 1brf1e64ai9otilha99bbnr06qqnjb6qio5l37u6feti8
    [ERROR] backup failed

Root problem:

Loaded index needs to be merged into the master one so that we skip
repacking things we don't need to.

Do we need to create a faux last snapshot as well? Without a snapshot,
we don't compare _anything_ to its previous state.

...WIP snapshot?

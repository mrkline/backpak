## `show` command

- Total bytes referenced (split into files/chunks and metadata/trees)

- Unique bytes vs reused bytes?
  Would need to look at all the other snapshots, wouldn't we?
  Maybe that's silly.

- # Packs referenced (note packs may contain data from other snapshots)

- Docs should explain that `cat` dumps raw data (JSON-ified records from files),
  `show` gathers metadata from a particular snapshot.

## `usage` command (or `statistics`? `info`?)

- # of all file types, size of those

- total size vs "unshared" sizes of all snapshots? (% duplicated?)

...prune should also probably show how many bytes it pruned, huh?

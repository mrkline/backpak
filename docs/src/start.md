# Getting Started

## Installation

[Get yourself a Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/) and run
```
$ cargo install backpak
```

Better packaging to follow.

## Creating a repository

Backpak saves backups in a _repository_. Let's make one in a local folder:
```
backpak --repository ~/myrepo init filesystem
```
If you'd like to upload to Backblaze B2,
in which case the `-r/--repository` flag just sets the repo's config file,
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo.toml \
    init --gpg MY_FAVORITE_GPG_KEY \
    backblaze \
        --key-id "deadbeef"
        --application-key "SOMEBASE64" \
        --bucket "matts-bakpak"
```
With the `--gpg` arg, Backpak will perform a quick check that it can round-trip data with
the given key (using `gpg --encrypt --recipient <KEY>`), then encrypt all files in the repo
with the same command. You can edit the repo [config file](./formats.md) to use a different,
arbitrary command.

More backends to follow.

## Backing up

Let's make a backup!

```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo backup ~/src/backpak/src
Walking {"/home/mrkline/src/backpak/src"} to see what we've got...
/ 297 KB
Opening repository srctest
Building a master index

Running backup...
/ P 17 KB + 7 KB | R 281 KB | Z 8 KB | U 9 KB
I 2 packs indexed
D 20 KB downloaded
/home/mrkline/src/backpak/src

Snaphsot afe4ajdi done
```
We print updates as we go:
- How much we **P**acked into this backup (files + metadata)
- How much we **R**eused from previous backups
- How much **Z**standard ensmallened the data
- How much we **U**ploaded

If interrupted, the incomplete `backup` will leave behind a `backpak-wip.index` and a handful
of other files. This allows Backpak to resume where it left off.

You can also:
- Pass multiple paths to `backup`.
- Specify a backup author with `--author` (otherwise the machine's hostname is used).
- Annotate your backup with `--tag`.
- Skip over files and folders (matching regular expressions) with `--skip`.
- Dereference symbolic links with `-L`.
- See what you'd backup with `--dry-run`.
  (Most commands have this!)

Your new backup is saved as a _snapshot_. You can view a list of the repository's snapshots with...
`snapshots`:
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo snapshots
...
snapshot afe4ajdifcgfkghmq2tivqlsjnptvri5inb8inn99k0k2
Author: my-desktop
Date:   Thu Nov 7 2024 22:55:36 US/Pacific

  - /home/me/src/backpak/src
```

## Manipulating snapshots

Each snapshot can be referenced by a few digits of its ID (enough to be unique),
or relative to the most recent snapshot â€” `LAST` is the latest,
followed by `LAST~`, then `LAST~2`, `LAST~3`, and so on.[^1]

Using these, we can do some routine things, like list the files in the snapshot:
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo ls LAST
src/
src/backend/
src/backend/backblaze.rs
src/backend/cache.rs
...
src/ui/snapshots.rs
src/ui/usage.rs
src/ui.rs
src/upload.rs
```

Or compare the snapshot to whatever's in the directory currently:
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo diff ra8o
   + src/some-new-thing
   + src/some-other-new-thing
```

## Restoring data

To restore a snapshot,
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo restore LAST
```
by default, `restore` doesn't delete anything that wasn't in the snapshot.
If you want to do that:
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo restore --delete LAST
- /home/me/src/backpak/src/some-new-thing
- /home/me/src/backpak/src/some-other-new-thing
```
Additional flags like `--times` and `--permissions` can restore metadata,
and `--output` can restore the snapshot to a different directory than where it came from.

If you'd like to dump an individual file from a snapshot, you can do that too:
```
$ backpak -r ~/myrepo dump LAST src/lib.rs
//! Some big dumb backup system.
//!
//! See the [`backup`] module for an overview and a crappy block diagram.

pub mod backend;
pub mod backup;
pub mod blob;
...
```
